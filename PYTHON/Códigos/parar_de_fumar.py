# pyQuit.py - Keeps track of your smoke-free life.
# by former smoker Rob Andrews on 8/2/2001
######################################################################################
# I'm just knocking some ideas around at this point.
# I quit smoking a few months ago, and it seems my friends are doing the same.
# I read somewhere today that each cigarette not smoked rescues 11 minutes of life.
# pyQuit.py asks the user for a details about a user's experience quitting smoking.
# I plan to add multi-user support, as well as cleaning up this messy code.
# I'd like to make the whole thing object-oriented based around the user.
# I have not yet added the ability for user data to be saved.
# I'm bumping around the idea of piddling around with versions of this 
# coded as CGI, Jython Applets, Python Server Pages, etc. just for fun.
# Once I finish with the internals here, I'll add an interface using something 
# along the lines of wxPython, Tkinter, and PMW.
# Another feature I plan to add is the ability for the user to select a date in 
# the future and be told how much life, money, time, etc. will be wasted by smoking 
# during the time leading up to that point.
# The time reporting is unrefined at this time. My current intention is to add fairly 
# thorough reporting of time, but I have yet to add something along the lines of "You have 
# been smoke-free for 1 year, 3 lunar months, 2 weeks, 5 days, 3 hours, and 59 minutes." 
# Since I have been slapping ideas together in this one file in a brief sitting, 
# I'm sure some of the code is useless, redundant, inefficient, or generally 
# disagreeable.
